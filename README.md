CGPA CALCULATOR
Explanation:

Struct Course: Defines a structure to hold information about a course: course code, credit hours, and grade points.
Input: Prompts the user to enter the number of courses and then collects details for each course, including the course code, credit hours, and grade points.
Calculations:
Calculates the total credit hours by summing the credit hours of all courses.
Calculates the total grade points by multiplying the credit hours and grade points for each course and summing them.
Calculates the CGPA by dividing the total grade points by the total credit hours.
Output: Displays the calculated CGPA with two decimal places.
Note:

Grade Point System: Ensure that the grade point system used matches the one in your institution. You may need to adjust the input and calculations accordingly.
Error Handling: Consider adding error handling to validate input, such as ensuring that credit hours and grade points are positive numbers.
User Interface: You can enhance the user interface by using formatted output, clear prompts, and error messages to guide the user.
Data Storage: For more complex applications, you might want to store the data in a file or database for future reference.
This program provides a basic framework for calculating CGPA. You can customize it further to meet your specific requirements and incorporate additional features.

LOGIN SYSTEM
Explanation:

Registration:
Prompts the user for a username and password.
Checks if the username already exists by trying to open a file with that name.
If the username is unique, creates a new file with the username and password.
Login:
Prompts the user for a username and password.
Tries to open the file corresponding to the entered username.
If the file exists, reads the stored username and password.
Compares the entered credentials with the stored ones.
If they match, the login is successful.
Security Considerations:

Password Hashing: For better security, consider using password hashing techniques like bcrypt or Argon2 to store hashed passwords instead of plain text.
Input Validation: Implement input validation to prevent malicious input and potential security vulnerabilities.
File Permissions: Ensure that the created files have appropriate permissions to protect user data.
Error Handling: Handle potential errors, such as file I/O errors, gracefully.
Session Management: For web applications, consider using session management techniques to track user sessions and maintain security.
This is a basic implementation. For more robust and secure systems, you may need to explore advanced security techniques, database integration, and user interface design.
